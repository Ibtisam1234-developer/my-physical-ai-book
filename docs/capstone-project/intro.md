# Capstone Project Introduction

Welcome to the capstone project, where you'll integrate everything you've learned to build a complete humanoid robot system with AI-powered capabilities.

## Project Overview

This capstone project represents the culmination of your learning journey through Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. You'll design, implement, and deploy a complete humanoid robot system that combines:

- **ROS 2** for distributed robot control
- **Simulation** with Isaac Sim for development and testing
- **NVIDIA Isaac** for GPU-accelerated perception and navigation
- **VLA Models** for intelligent task understanding and execution

## Project Goals

By completing this capstone, you will:

1. **Design** a complete system architecture for a humanoid robot
2. **Implement** all core subsystems (perception, planning, control)
3. **Integrate** components into a cohesive platform
4. **Test** in simulation and validate performance
5. **Document** your design decisions and implementation

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Design
- Define your robot's capabilities and constraints
- Design system architecture
- Plan component interactions
- Create technical specifications

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Build perception pipeline
- Implement navigation and motion planning
- Integrate VLA for task understanding
- Develop control systems

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- Integrate all subsystems
- Test individual components
- Validate end-to-end workflows
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 4: Deployment and Documentation
- Deploy to simulation environment
- (Optional) Deploy to real hardware
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Present your project

## Expected Deliverables

1. **System Architecture Document**: Detailed design of your robot system
2. **Implementation**: Working code for all components
3. **Integration**: Fully integrated system demonstration
4. **Test Results**: Performance metrics and validation data
5. **Documentation**: Technical documentation and user guide
6. **Presentation**: Video demonstration and technical presentation

## Evaluation Criteria

Your capstone project will be evaluated on:

- **Technical Correctness** (30%): Does it work as intended?
- **System Design** (20%): Is the architecture well-designed?
- **Integration Quality** (20%): How well do components work together?
- **Innovation** (15%): Creative solutions and improvements
- **Documentation** (15%): Clear, comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

Ready to begin? Proceed to:
- [System Architecture](./system-architecture.md) to design your robot
- [Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md) for step-by-step instructions
- [Final Summary](./final-summary.md) for project wrap-up
